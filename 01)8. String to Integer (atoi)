Leetcode 8. String to Integer (atoi) step by step.
I’ll give you:

Problem Statement

Intuition & Framework

Inline Dry Run inside the Code (with comments just before logic)

Final Clean Version of Code

🔹 Problem Statement
Implement the function myAtoi(string s), which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (like C/C++'s atoi function).

Rules:

Ignore leading whitespace.

Optional sign (+ or -).

Read in next digits until a non-digit character is found.

If no digits found → return 0.

Clamp result within [-2^31, 2^31 - 1].

🔹 Intuition / Framework
Step 1: Trim leading whitespaces.

Step 2: Handle sign (+ or -).

Step 3: Extract digits until non-digit.

Step 4: Convert to integer while handling overflow.

We keep checking overflow at each step before multiplying by 10 and adding digit.

🔹 Code with Inline Dry Run
Let’s take example:
s = " -42abc"

cpp
Copy code
class Solution {
public:
    int myAtoi(string s) {
        int i = 0, n = s.size();
        long long result = 0; // use long long to detect overflow
        int sign = 1;

        // ---------------- Step 1: Ignore leading whitespaces ----------------
        // Example: "   -42abc"
        // i=0 -> ' ' skip, i=1 -> ' ' skip, i=2 -> ' ' skip
        while(i < n && s[i] == ' ') i++;

        // ---------------- Step 2: Handle sign ----------------
        // Now i=3 -> s[3] = '-' so sign = -1
        if(i < n && (s[i] == '+' || s[i] == '-')) {
            sign = (s[i] == '-') ? -1 : 1;
            i++;
        }

        // ---------------- Step 3: Process digits ----------------
        // Now i=4 -> '4'
        while(i < n && isdigit(s[i])) {
            int digit = s[i] - '0'; // '4' -> 4

            // ---------------- Step 4: Check overflow before using result ----------------
            // max = 2147483647, min = -2147483648
            if(result > (INT_MAX - digit) / 10) {
                return (sign == 1) ? INT_MAX : INT_MIN;
            }

            result = result * 10 + digit;  
            // Dry run:
            // result = 0*10+4 = 4 (i=4)
            // Next i=5 -> '2'
            // result = 4*10+2 = 42 (i=5)
            i++;
        }

        // ---------------- Step 5: Apply sign ----------------
        // final = -42
        return (int)(result * sign);
    }
};
🔹 Dry Run on " -42abc"
Step 1: skip spaces → i=3

Step 2: sign = -1 (-)

Step 3: process digits

result=0 → digit=4 → result=4

result=4 → digit=2 → result=42

stop at a

Step 4: apply sign → -42

✅ Output: -42


✅ Interview Trick to Remember:

Think of atoi like “state machine”:

Whitespace → Sign → Digits → Stop

Always check overflow before multiplying by 10.



Let’s break down Step 2: Handle sign carefully, with example-driven reasoning.

🔹 Code Fragment
// ---------------- Step 2: Handle sign ----------------
// Now i=3 -> s[3] = '-' so sign = -1
if(i < n && (s[i] == '+' || s[i] == '-')) {
    sign = (s[i] == '-') ? -1 : 1;
    i++;
}

🔹 Why This Step?

After skipping whitespaces, the string may start with an optional sign character:

'+' → number is positive

'-' → number is negative

If neither → assume positive

Example inputs:

" -42abc" → sign is -

" +123" → sign is +

" 4193 with words" → no sign → assume +

🔹 Explanation Line by Line

Condition:

if(i < n && (s[i] == '+' || s[i] == '-'))


i < n → make sure we’re not out of bounds

(s[i] == '+' || s[i] == '-') → check if the character is a sign

✅ Example: s = " -42abc", after skipping spaces, i = 3, s[3] = '-'
Condition is true.

Ternary Operator:

sign = (s[i] == '-') ? -1 : 1;


If current char is '-', then sign = -1

Else (means '+'), sign = 1

✅ In " -42abc", s[3] == '-' → so sign = -1

✅ In " +56", s[3] == '+' → so sign = 1

Advance Index:

i++;


We’ve already processed the sign, so move i forward to the first digit.

" -42abc" → i goes from 3 to 4 → now points to '4'

" +56" → i goes from 3 to 4 → now points to '5'

🔹 Dry Run on " -42abc"

Initial: i=0 → skip spaces until i=3

s[3] == '-' → condition true

sign = -1

i++ → 4 (points to '4')

So final state after Step 2:

sign = -1

i = 4 (ready to read digits)

👉 So essentially, this step is just about deciding if the number is negative or positive, and then moving past the sign character.

Do you want me to also inline dry run with " +123" and "4193 words" to show how this step behaves differently in each case?

explain in same way now onfards remainng code
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ✅ Let’s continue in the same structured way (line-by-line, with dry run + explanation).
We already finished Step 2: Handle sign. Now we move to the remaining code.

🔹 Step 3: Process Digits
while(i < n && isdigit(s[i])) {
    int digit = s[i] - '0';

🔹 Why this?

We now expect digits (0–9), so keep processing until we hit a non-digit.

isdigit(s[i]) ensures we only take valid numbers.

Convert char → int using s[i] - '0'.

🔹 Dry Run " -42abc"

i=4, s[4] = '4' → digit = 4

i=5, s[5] = '2' → digit = 2

i=6, s[6] = 'a' → stop loop

✅ Only "42" is extracted.

🔹 Step 4: Overflow Check
if(result > (INT_MAX - digit) / 10) {
    return (sign == 1) ? INT_MAX : INT_MIN;
}

🔹 Why this?

We must check before multiplying by 10 and adding digit, to prevent overflow.

Formula ensures:

result∗10+digit≤INT_MAX

If overflow happens → clamp:

Positive → INT_MAX (2,147,483,647)

Negative → INT_MIN (-2,147,483,648)

🔹 Dry Run " -42abc"

First digit '4': result=0
Check: 0 > (2147483647 - 4)/10 ? → false

Second digit '2': result=4
Check: 4 > (2147483647 - 2)/10 ? → false
✅ No overflow → safe to proceed.

🔹 Step 5: Build Result
result = result * 10 + digit;
i++;

🔹 Why this?

Multiply previous result by 10, then add new digit.

Advance i to next character.

🔹 Dry Run " -42abc"

First digit '4': result = 0*10 + 4 = 4, i=5

Second digit '2': result = 4*10 + 2 = 42, i=6

Next is 'a' → loop breaks

✅ Final result = 42

🔹 Step 6: Apply Sign
return (int)(result * sign);

🔹 Why this?

Apply the sign we determined earlier (+ or -).

Convert back to int (safe since we handled overflow).

🔹 Dry Run " -42abc"

result = 42

sign = -1

return 42 * -1 = -42

✅ Final Answer = -42

🔹 Full Walkthrough on " -42abc"

Skip spaces → i=3

Detect '-' → sign=-1, i=4

Process digits:

digit=4 → result=4

digit=2 → result=42

stop at 'a'

Apply sign → -42

🔹 Complexity

Time: O(n) (scan once)

Space: O(1) (constant vars)

⚡ Now, here’s a thought:
Would you like me to repeat this same style dry run on "4193 with words" and "words and 987" so you see how stopping early and returning 0 works?

You said:
what is the goal in the question  , how to get it meansw i don't understand
ChatGPT said:

Great question 👌 — let’s zoom out and really understand the goal of Leetcode 8. String to Integer (atoi) before we even talk about code.

🔹 What is the Question Asking?

We are asked to mimic the behavior of the C atoi function:
Convert a string into a valid 32-bit signed integer following certain rules.

🔹 What Does That Mean?

Imagine you have different messy strings like:

" -42abc"

"4193 with words"

"words and 987"

" +000123"

"91283472332"

Our job is to extract the first integer from this string (if it exists), with these steps:

🔹 Step-by-Step Goal

Ignore leading spaces

" -42abc" → skip spaces → "-42abc"

Check optional sign (+ or -)

"-42abc" → sign = negative

Read digits until something invalid

From "-42abc" → digits are "42", stop at 'a'

Form the integer

"42" → 42

Apply the sign

Since sign = negative → -42

Clamp result if it’s too big or too small

Example: "91283472332" → this is bigger than INT_MAX (2147483647) → so answer = 2147483647.

🔹 The Goal in Plain Words

👉 The goal is:

Extract the first valid number from the string (considering whitespace, sign, digits, stopping at invalid chars), and make sure it fits inside the 32-bit integer range.

If no valid number can be formed → return 0.

🔹 Example Walkthroughs
Example 1

s = " -42abc"

Skip spaces → "-42abc"

Sign = -

Digits = "42"

Convert → 42

Apply sign → -42 ✅

Example 2

s = "4193 with words"

No spaces, no sign

Digits = "4193"

Convert → 4193 ✅

Example 3

s = "words and 987"

First char is not space, not sign, not digit → invalid

Return 0 ✅

Example 4

s = "91283472332"

Digits = "91283472332"

This > INT_MAX → clamp to 2147483647 ✅

🔹 So, the Core Idea

We’re not just parsing numbers blindly.

We must follow the “rules of conversion” step by step.

The main trick: detect digits safely and handle overflow correctly.

👉 Does this clarify the ultimate goal of the question?
If yes, I can show you a visual diagram (flow of states) so you see how input moves through: whitespace → sign → digits → stop/clamp. Would you like that?

You said:
        while(i < n && isdigit(s[i])) {
            int digit = s[i] - '0'; // '4' -> 4

            // ---------------- Step 4: Check overflow before using result ----------------
            // max = 2147483647, min = -2147483648
            if(result > (INT_MAX - digit) / 10) {
                return (sign == 1) ? INT_MAX : INT_MIN;
            } explain this 
ChatGPT said:

Excellent 👌 — this is the most critical part of atoi: overflow handling.
Let’s carefully break it down.

🔹 The Code
while(i < n && isdigit(s[i])) {
    int digit = s[i] - '0'; // convert char to int

    // ---------------- Step 4: Check overflow before using result ----------------
    // max = 2147483647, min = -2147483648
    if(result > (INT_MAX - digit) / 10) {
        return (sign == 1) ? INT_MAX : INT_MIN;
    }

🔹 Why Do We Need This?

Our target is a 32-bit signed integer:

−
2
31
  
≤
  
𝑥
  
≤
  
2
31
−
1
−2
31
≤x≤2
31
−1

That’s [-2147483648, 2147483647].

When we process digits, we do:

result = result * 10 + digit;


But multiplying by 10 and adding might overflow before we even assign it.
So we must check in advance.

🔹 The Formula
if(result > (INT_MAX - digit) / 10)


👉 What does this mean?

Suppose we want to compute:

𝑛
𝑒
𝑤
𝑅
𝑒
𝑠
𝑢
𝑙
𝑡

𝑒

result≤

INT_MAX−digit
	​


If result is greater than this bound, the next multiplication will overflow.

🔹 Example Dry Run: "91283472332"

result = 912834723

Next digit = 3

Check:

result > (2147483647 - 3) / 10
912834723 > 214748364 / ? YES (true)


Since true → Overflow!

So we return clamp:

If sign = + → INT_MAX (2147483647)

If sign = - → INT_MIN (-2147483648)

🔹 Why (sign == 1) ? INT_MAX : INT_MIN ?

If the number is positive → we can’t exceed INT_MAX → clamp there.

If the number is negative → we can’t go below INT_MIN → clamp there.

🔹 Example Walkthroughs
Example 1: "21474836460"

At digit "2147483646", result is already close to max.

Next digit makes result too big.

Condition triggers → return 2147483647.

Example 2: "-91283472332"

Same overflow check happens.

But since sign = -, return INT_MIN = -2147483648.

✅ In short:
This check prevents integer overflow by detecting the problem before it happens, and clamps result to INT_MAX or INT_MIN depending on sign.

👉 Do you want me to mathematically prove why the condition is (result > (INT_MAX - digit) / 10) instead of checking after result = result * 10 + digit?

You said:

int digit = s\[i\] - '0'; // convert char to int

explain how this converting
ChatGPT said:

Ah! Now we’re talking about how '0'–'9' characters are converted to their integer values in C++.

🔹 The Code
int digit = s[i] - '0'; // '4' -> 4

🔹 How This Works

Characters in C++ have ASCII codes

'0' → ASCII 48

'1' → ASCII 49

'2' → ASCII 50

…

'9' → ASCII 57

Subtraction gives the numeric value

Example: s[i] = '4'

'4' - '0' → 52 - 48 = 4

So any digit character '0'–'9' minus '0' gives its actual integer value.

🔹 Dry Run Example
s = "42"
i = 0
s[0] = '4'
digit = s[0] - '0' = 52 - 48 = 4

i = 1
s[1] = '2'
digit = s[1] - '0' = 50 - 48 = 2


Now digit is a real integer that we can do arithmetic with: result = result * 10 + digit.

✅ Key Idea:

'0'–'9' are characters, not numbers.

Subtract '0' to map '0'→0, '1'→1, ..., '9'→9.

This is a standard trick in all languages with ASCII/Unicode
